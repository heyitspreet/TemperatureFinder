# Thermal Imaging for monitoring temperature
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for non-invasive and contactless temperature screening methods has become paramount to prevent the spread of the virus. Traditional methods of temperature measurement often require close physical contact, putting both individuals at risk. Our solution addresses this challenge by offering a safe, efficient, and real-time approach to screening the body temperature of individuals in various environments, such as airports, hospitals, public transportation hubs, and other crowded spaces.

## Key Features:

Non-contact temperature measurement: Eliminate the risk of direct contact and maintain social distancing guidelines during temperature screenings.
Thermal camera integration: Utilize the thermal camera's data, which provides a visual representation of the temperature distribution on a temperature scale.
Face detection: Identify and locate human faces within the captured images, enabling the targeted measurement of individuals' temperatures.
Multi-face temperature measurement: Efficiently measure the temperatures of multiple people in a single frame, streamlining the screening process in crowded settings.
Real-time analysis: Provide instantaneous temperature readings, ensuring timely responses in case of elevated temperatures.
## How It Works:
Our system combines advanced image processing techniques with the power of MATLAB to analyze thermal images from the camera. The thermal camera captures infrared radiation emitted by objects, including human bodies. By converting the thermal data into a visual representation with a temperature scale, we can easily identify variations in body temperature.

Through face detection algorithms, our system locates faces within the thermal images. Subsequently, the temperature values corresponding to the detected face regions are extracted from the temperature scale. The collected temperature data is then processed, and real-time temperature readings of individuals are displayed.

We believe that by providing an efficient and safe method of temperature screening, our project can contribute to the broader efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As an open-source initiative, we welcome contributions from the community, enabling us to continually improve the accuracy and effectiveness of our system.
